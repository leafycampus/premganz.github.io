The leafycampus foundation for studies in information technology and development is constituted hereby as an institution to pursue the ends detailed out hereunder:
To constitute a dedicated institution consisting of people, facilities, principles and a hinterland of people, working systematically without being pegged towards the pragmatic notions of material enrichment. This institution shall primarily work intellectually to acquire knowledge in ever increasing reflection of its pure form and base it to create pragmatic adaptations, so that consistency is advocated as a higher ideal than completeness. 
The completeness of social groups is to be attempted of materialization by complete knowledge based productive centers which are embraced by specific social groups which define their completness in cultural and artistic terms. This could be achieved only by a context bound definition of development.
Hence development of specific social groups is to be attempted by intellectual pursuit of pure knowledge, standardization of what constitutes the bounds of consistency for an applied system and leaving the incomplete areas to be managed culturally and by spiritual contemplation.
The knowledge might be the base for pragmatic adapatation resulting in productive free energy in the social system.
The standardization of consistency of such adaptive systems might arise from a tolerance and entertainment of pluralism over an intellectual arena which has due processes of critical examinations and peaceful processes and reflection of universal notions of morality.
The instution shall play the role of emancipator of specific groups, concrete or abstract by inspiration, publication, experimental and model projects.
A redemptive and context bound notion of development is proposed in a critical frame to the postmodernist construct of feedback driven, unbounded and highly subjective notions of progression of human activities, leading to emergent unifying entities, that cause fragmentation distress to individuals.
The authority of the institution is aimed to be moral and it is concieved as an idealistic one delinked to practical, material considerations.Its energies might however be directed to immediate humanitarian work even if it does not involve intellectual dimensions.
This is critical of unified notions of development over incremental problem solving power, the ability to produce greater choice to the individual while the costs themselves are collected by means that are neither transparent nor tractable. 
This engineering of unbounded, action cross-messaging platforms with minimal policy orchestration, it is felt might lead to emergent, intractable complexes. These complexes bind humans to closed infinite loops of production and consumption, with intelligent random moves migrating into the network. 
This is a metanarrative of the individuality and pluralism of narratives of development and the singularity of objective reductive knowledge, itself contained recursively in the metanarrative of plurality of ideas, openness to crticism and peaceful methods.

There are risks with this approach as well - conflict had arisen in the past not only out of resource sharing but also from egotism of identity (we can ontologically seperate this from evolutionary concerns). 
Cultures are identity reinforcing, independent of narratives of development. In Postmodernity mass media, consumerism and urbanization disperses culture into monotones, with microcultures emerging as transcient and forceful from time to time. These microcultures are vigourous and celeberatory or of anonymous heroism, rather than sustained in tackling problems. There is also a merging of leisure and work - as with standup comedians, representing a more general ambivalence characteristic of postmodernity. Emergent microcultures, as city belongingness satiate identity needs while being benign and open. 
We argue for restoration of leisure, work differentiation, concrete permanent identities negotiated and conflict mitigated by meta identities that overarch and sustain balance. It demands an optimism in human conflict resolution abilities, of Chivalry and Grace. It demands commitment to institutions and acknowledgement of imminent conflict, capable of resolution by deliberation, specific appointed venues like sports meet, fair towns and overarching ideas like regional agglomerations.
We present hardening of recursive structures as natural and emergent and hence their explicit construction as being desirable, as just one point of our critical representation to the general trend towards postmodernist homogenity.
