Theories define 'necessary conditions' for materialization of phenomena, but not the sufficient conditions, for which causal interconnection between phenomena is required by empiricism. UV and oxygen might be necessary conditions for the emergence of ozone but the arising of ozone is not explained sufficiently by the combination of the causative agents. There is an inherent stochasticity involved due to which the set of sufficient conditions (to reproduce the event) might carry a stochastic noise. In such cases where the stochasticity is a cover for latent factors awaiting a complete enumeration of the elements of the set of sufficient causes. Empiricism helps in establishing temporal sequence after excluding other factors (in controlled conditions) which might have latent effects. Empiricism is hence a connection of phenomena, finding its root at the experimentor out of his free will performing certain actions. The intentions and biases of the experimentor, as well as the feedback loop flowing from outcomes is not generally considered material.
Connecting phenomena by means of a stochastic belief network or empirical sequence of phenomena is a bayesian network. If causality or theory could be inferred from was discussed in Pearl and Verma.


Decisions one would regret - Regressive tendencies in network based intelligence
======
It might however confer dynamic advantage which might be balanced at crtical points of regression.


3. Consolation by reflection as being an essential part of mental health. 
======
The cognitive roots of mental distress, where the perception of a person is unharmonized with the general population arises due to the difference in the cognitive objectivism over the degree and place of randomness in the world. Thus, mental health is not only a construct of norms, but of the ability to percieve the objective common reality, that 'is'.
